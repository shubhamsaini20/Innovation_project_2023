# Predicting FAANG Stocks

In this notebook we'll focus on analysing the stock data of the **FAANG** companies. We will look at everything from scraping stock data of the **S&P500 companies** to visualizing the scraped data, analysing it and finally ***predicting*** the stock prices using various methods. The S&P500, which is short for **Standard & Poor's 500**, was introduced in 1957 as a stock market index to track the value of 500 corporations that have their stocks listed on the ***New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)*** and the ***NASDAQ Composite***. Standard & Poor's provides financial data, credit ratings for investments, and various equity indices. The collection of stocks that make up the S&P500 is designed to represent most of the composition of the U.S. economy. As a result, the value of the S&P and various stocks within the index is closely watched by market participants since their performance represents a gauge of the health of the U.S. economy.
